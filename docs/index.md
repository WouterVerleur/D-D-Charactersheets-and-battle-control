# D&D Charactersheets and battle control
A simple program designed for a D&amp;D group to create Character sheets and use them as a guide for a battle. This program creates a battle master when started on a computer that does not have the program running. Any other computer in the network can than connect to the battle master to create a slave of this master. This way the DM has control over the battle and party members can view information like the order and the health of friendly characters.

You can download a jar of the latest version [here]({{ site.url }}/downloads/dndbattle-2.5.jar).  
Requires Java 8 or higher.
