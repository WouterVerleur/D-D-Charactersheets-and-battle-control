# D&D Charactersheets and battle control
A simple program designed for a D&amp;D group to create Character sheets and use them as a guide for a battle. This program creates a battle master when started on a computer that does not have the program running. Any other computer in the network can than connect to the battle master to create a slave of this master. This way the DM has control over the battle and party members can view information like the order and the health of friendly characters.
